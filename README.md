# EasyRename
A Fabric Mod to make renaming containers easier

Made this because I was too lazy to break my chest filled with items and then find a chest to put all the
items into and then put the chest in the anvil and then rename it and then place it down and then get the
items from the other chest and slowly transfer the items into the chest again.
