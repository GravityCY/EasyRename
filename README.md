**Currently breaks some Vanilla Tweaks Resource Packs due to them expecting the Container Names to always be a specific name, not sure I can do much about that.**

Made this because I was too lazy to break my chest filled with items and then find a chest to put all the
items into and then put the chest in the anvil and then rename it and then place it down and then get the
items from the other chest and slowly transfer the items into the chest again.

Yoinked this idea from a friendly fellow MR_ZE ![head](https://s.namemc.com/2d/skin/face.png?id=c01197d831c1902f&scale=4), thanks buddy!
