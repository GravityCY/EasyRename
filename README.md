**Also adds a Config Option to rename Item Frames on containers!**\
**This works really nicely with <a href="${inventory_tabs}" target="_blank">InventoryTabs</a> Item Frame naming functionality!**

## Fair Warning
### Dedicated Server
**Using this on a dedicated server is slightly more clunky as you'd have to go into the config files to change any configs. (%minecraft_folder%/config/easyrename.json)**

### Experimental
**Currently, kind of experimental, till people find bugs. The way I've implemented it doesn't seem very compatible in the grand scheme of things, if you find something (a mod, or an inventory etc.) that doesn't work please report on the Mod's Github issues page**

### Breaks
**Currently, breaks some Vanilla Tweaks Resource Packs due to them expecting the Container Names to always be a specific name, not sure I can do much about that.**

Made this because I was too lazy to break my chest filled with items and then find a chest to put all the
items into and then put the chest in the anvil and then rename it and then place it down and then get the
items from the other chest and slowly transfer the items into the chest again.

Yoinked this idea from a fellow called MR_ZE ![head](https://s.namemc.com/2d/skin/face.png?id=c01197d831c1902f&scale=2), thanks lil guy!
